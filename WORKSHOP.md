# Age Transformation Workshop

Welcome to the **Age Transformation Workshop**! This guide will help you set up everything you need to get started quickly.

## Prerequisites

Since we're using **GitHub Codespaces**, all necessary system tools like Python are already preinstalled. Let's jump right in!

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies  
Run the following command to install all required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Download the Model  
Instead of downloading to your local machine, use this command to download the model directly into your Codespace:

```bash
wget -O large-aging-model.h5 https://huggingface.co/spaces/penpen/age-transformation/resolve/main/large-aging-model.h5?download=true
```

This will save the model file (`large-aging-model.h5`) in the current working directory of your Codespace.

---

## You're All Set!

Once the dependencies are installed and the model is downloaded, you're ready to dive into the code and explore age transformation models ðŸŽ‰.

Happy coding!
